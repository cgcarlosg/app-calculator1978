Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Prerequisites
Computer running Mac OS, Windows, or Linux Ubuntu.

Internet browser: Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, etc...

Install NodeJs

Optional (For deployment)

Install Heroku CLI

Setup
Download the code or copy the git repository to your computer.

To install dependencies you need to run the following command in your terminal.

  npm install
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

Deployment
This project is deployed to Heroku, but you can use Netlify or other platforms you like.

For Heroku deployment we you can enter each of the following commands.

    heroku create your-app-name --buildpack mars/create-react-app

    // you can remove 'your-app-name' if you don't know what name to put


    git push heroku master

    // if you are deploying the project from the master branch


    git push heroku your-branch:master

    // if you are deploying from a branch different from master


    heroku open
And there you go! You have your app deployed to Heroku.
